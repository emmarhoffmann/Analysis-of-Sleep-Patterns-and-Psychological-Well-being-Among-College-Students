# Analysis of Sleep Patterns and Psychological Well-being Among College Students

## Overview
This project investigates the connection between sleep patterns, mental health, and academic performance among college students. Using the "SleepStudy" dataset with 253 student observations, the analysis addresses questions regarding stress, anxiety, depression, alcohol use, and GPA. The project leverages R for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Key Research Questions
- Is there a significant difference in stress scores between male and female students?
- Do students with high stress levels miss more classes or consume more alcohol?
- Are there correlations between drinks consumed, classes missed, and GPA?
- How are depression, anxiety, and stress scores related to one another?

## Data & Methodology
The dataset includes variables like Gender, ClassYear, LarkOwl (sleep preferences), GPA, ClassesMissed, DepressionScore, AnxietyScore, and StressScore. The analysis involved:
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values.
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations, including boxplots, t-tests, and correlation matrices.
- R was used to perform the analysis and generate insights.

## Results
- **Gender and Stress**: Female students reported significantly higher stress levels than males.
- **Classes Missed and Stress**: No significant difference in classes missed based on stress levels.
- **Alcohol and Stress**: High-stress students did not consume more alcohol than those with normal stress.
- **GPA and Sleep Preferences**: Students identifying as "Larks" had a slightly higher GPA than "Owls."
- **Correlation**: Weak correlations were found between stress, anxiety, depression, and other behavioral patterns.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights various factors affecting college students' well-being, with gender differences in stress being a significant finding. Additionally, the relationships between mental health, sleep patterns, and academic performance provide valuable insights for future research and potential interventions to enhance student well-being.
